GM said Monday it will invest $2.2 billion into its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant to produce all-electric trucks and SUVs as well as a self-driving vehicle unveiled by its subsidiary Cruise. The automaker will invest an additional $800 million in supplier tooling and other projects related to the launch of the new electric trucks.

GM will kick off this new program with an all-electric pickup truck that will go into production in late 2021. The Cruise Origin, the electric self-driving shuttle designed for ride sharing, will be the second vehicle to go into production at the Detroit area plant.

Detroit-Hamtramck will be GMâ€™s first fully-dedicated electric vehicle assembly plant. When fully operational, the plant will create more than 2,200 jobs, according to GM.
